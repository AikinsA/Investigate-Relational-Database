## Investigate a Relational Database
I used SQL to explore a database related to movie rentals. I wrote SQL code to run SQL queries and answer questions about the database.

The project end-result is a presentation of four slides. Each slide:

* Has a question of interest. 
* Has a supporting SQL query needed to answer the question. 
* Has a supporting visualization created using the final data of my SQL query that answers my question of interest. The four questions of interest are:

1. What are the first 15 customers who paid maximum amount of money?
2. How many inventories have the same time length less than an hour?
3. What are the Horror film names that have rental rate greater than total average rental?
4. What is the average rental r a te for all film categories Except Cincinatti film?
